# How to contribute

1. Open an issue
2. if you are new to this project:

   2.1 fork the project (if you don't have it yet)

   2.2 Clone your own forked repository (`git clone ...`)

3. Checkout the latest version of the base branch (if it is different from master - rare but possible situation)
4. Create a new branch and checkout it - this will be the place where you can solve the issue.
5. Write patches, commit them and push them into your forked repo.
   * PLEASE, DO NOT FORGET to reference the issue (e.g. ref #123 or closes #123).
   * PLEASE, BEAR IN MIND our CodingStyle and commit policy.
6. When you think you are done, create a Pull Request using GitHub web interface.
7. After merging your Pull Request, your temporary branch is useless. Checkout the base branch (usually `master`) and prune deleted branches (`git fetch --all -p`)
