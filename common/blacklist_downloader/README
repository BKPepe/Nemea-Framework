Blacklist Downloader README

   Blacklist Downloader is set of functions used to download website content
using GNU wget utility. It is initialized by array of url addresses, array of file names
and create child process. This new process then stores each websites content to its
coresponding file and then it sends signal SIGUSR1 to its parent process to signalize
that update is done.

Usage:
   Modul which want to use Blacklist Downloader will first call function:
      bl_down_init(page, file, count);
   Where page  is array of url addresses
         file  is array of file names
         count is count of url addresses/file names
   Function will then return ID of child process if succeed, otherwise it returns -1.
   If succeed, parent process will periodically receive signal SIGUSR1 from child process.
